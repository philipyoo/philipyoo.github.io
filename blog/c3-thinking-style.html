        Everyone has a certain style of studying and learning. Some methods can be more effective. It all comes down to discovering what type of learner you are, and how to adjust your learning style in order to best optimize your learning experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregoric Thinking Style</a>, I am a mix between concrete sequential, concrete random, and abstract sequential. Out of the three categories, I fall strongest within concrete sequential. According to the article, as a learner, I like order, logical sequence, following directions, predictability, and getting facts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Give it a try yourself! <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Take the test</a> and see what category you fall in and compare the results with your past experiences with learning and studying.

        As of this post, I am now in my third week of the remote Devbootcamp course. I have learned quite a bit: git, GitHub, terminal, irb, HTML, CSS, and Ruby. It definitely isn't easy, and requires a lot of time and persistence, but I think I have made it this far and am far from burning out because of my interest with programming and web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given my Gregoric Thinking style, I believe I have used it to the best of my ability thus far with the DBC curriculum. The curriculum is ordered in a way where you learn from the bottom up and has exercises along the way to reinforce concepts and commands. There are estimated time spent provided for each section based on previous students' reports. Also, there are pairing sessions each week to create a group working environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the structure and details provided, and the ability to plan ahead based on the estimated times per section, I have been working through the curriculum in an orderly fashion. Getting additional information is fairly easy to get since there are multiple forms of communication including a Google+ forum, email list with other students, and the ability to search for answers via Google or Stack Overflow. Everything has been streamlined and fits my thinking/learning habits well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it says that working in groups is hard for a concrete sequential thinker, so far, I haven't had too many problems working with others. I try to be as open as possible and ask questions whenever I get confused. If my partner is confused and asks a question, I try to explain things based on how I want to be explained it. After explaining something, I try to confirm with them if they understood. If they didn't, then I try to explain in another way and try to fit their thinking habits as best as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abstract concepts can be hard for me to understand. So far with the curriculum, I haven't had too many problems because I have had some exposure to each topic. I believe as the curriculum goes deeper, I will struggle with some concepts and will definitely prepare for these roadblocks by asking questions and understanding abstract concepts through practicing by testing inputs and seeing the results.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an optimal way of studying and learning for each person. It's just a matter of trying things out and finding which works best for you. Try to find out your Gregoric Thinking style, and see if adjusting your learning habits based on this style helps with your studies. If not, did any specific steps seem better to you? Maybe you should keep those steps and see if you can adjust the other steps to best serve you.
