          <p>
            What is Identity and Stereotype Threat?
          </p>
          <p>
            Pioneered by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson, Identity and Stereotype Threat is a psychological hindrance people unknowingly fall into whereby risk of confirming stereotypes based on different factors including race/ethnicity, sex, and social standing among many other factors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on their studies, they found students performed worse when put in a situation where a fallacy about their race, sex, or other traits would prove them to be true. Because one group may feel intellectually inferior to another group, the psychological effects of feeling inferior results in poorer results, thus "proving" the fallacy true.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a strange convention; a study of the pysche, something that is intangible, but through research, proves to be true. The power of the mind and where you place yourself will affect how effectively you function. As much as you want to deny this, it's something subconscious that we can't really look past until we realize and try to fix this.
          </p>
          <p>
            My parents moved to the U.S. right after getting married. As a second-generation Korean-American, my parents stressed the importance of education and material wealth. It is a very common importance amongst South Koreans because of the extreme poverty the country faced right after the war that split the North and the South.
          </p>
          <p>
            Growing up, I hated the fact that my parents would always make comparisons. Success in one Korean family's children would spread like wildfire amongst their own communities. In result, I grew to be a very sensitive person who felt very inferior (in complete honesty). Sadly, I sort of accepted my inferiority and don't have very high self-esteem.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that I fall into some degree of Identity and Stereotype Threat. I would say that it's more of psychological hindrance I face amongst my community and my peers. Although I would love to understand and grasp information quicker and with more depth, I really can't. Because of this feeling of defeat, I felt that I was restricted in what career I could pursue.
          </p>
          <p>
            My pursuit to learning web development and programming is definitely a huge step for me. It really is the first time, probably since high school, where I truly want to pursue something. Originally, when I thought about learning programming, I thought that I would not make it. It requires a great knowledge of math, conceptual understanding, and non-visual mapping or understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thankfully, I'm enjoying the learning process. I'm very curious, I like to test things out, and I like to explore unknown regions. I understand that some people will grasp this information quicker. Some people will probably build some amazing tools and projects. And thankfully, I'm not comparing myself to them. Rather, I'm focused on learning all the tools I can in order to build my own cool projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm sort of getting off-track here, but I wanted to share a little more about myself and how I felt like I fall into Stereotype Threat. Currently, as I'm learning programming, I do get worried at times, but for the most part, I'm enjoying the process, and my feelings of inferiority is put in the back seat.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is scary to think how much of our subconscious affects us in our daily lives. It restricts us, binds us down, and tells us we can't do something, and it does this all without us knowing. Our society today is definitely not perfect. Racism and sexism is still very much prevalent. Monetary value and self-importance drives many of us down the wrong paths.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I believe society is improving. We are acknowledging that we face all these problems, as where before we were in complete denial of them. I believe society will continue to improve, and as stereotypes are (hopefully) forgotten and lost, maybe we will see Stereotype Threat disappear.
