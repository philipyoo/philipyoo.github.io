        Q: When you think of the times in your life where you've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which values come to mind?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking about times I've been happiest, proudest, or most satisfied, events like graduation, meeting with friends, learning and understanding concepts, being able to teach or help others, and playing games come to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        With these in mind, I think values that are important to me include accomplishment, reputation, knowledge, challenge, and loyalty. Values that I'm constantly working on are confidence, self-respect, and responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: For the values you chose, give a 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree) rating based on if you live up to these values.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accomplishment (3)<br/>
        Reputation (4)<br/>
        Knowledge (3)<br/>
        Challenge (3)<br/>
        Loyalty (5)<br/>
        Confidence (2)<br/>
        Self-Respect (2)<br/>
        Responsiblity (4)<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        All the values above are important to me, but it doesn't always mean I try to achieve them. I'd like to be able to continue to pursue each of those values, but I feel like sometimes I just burnout or just want to do nothing at all. One very important value for me is reputation. Amongst my peers, especially at work, I always work to the best of my ability. The last thing I want happening is to drag everyone down. I believe I'm also very lenient and am not critical towards others. Instead, if I understand a more efficient way of accomplishing the job, I try to teach them, or if I can support them, I try to. I believe relationship amongst your group is very important and improves the work space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Did it relate to any of the values you found important?
      </p>
      <p>
        A recent conversation I had with one of my friends was about finishing college and job searching. Now, I'm probably not the best person on this subject, but I can say that I've had my own personal failures and I can share my experiences and any regrets I have. This friend of mine moved to the U.S. about 8 years ago. He dropped out of college and worked at a few odd jobs. He was not happy with where he was headed, so he decided to go back to college and is majoring in Accounting. He is now entering his last year in college and is worried about the job market and what to do exactly. To make a long conversation short, I suggested interning for the last year. Start searching right away, gain work experience ahead of graduating, and that extra experience will help a ton in his job search afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may not be the best advice, but I believe its sound advice. Based on my past experiences, I knew how important job experience was. Getting a head-start will put you above the herd.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?
      </p>
      <p>
        I do think it can mediate stereotype threat if I actively pursue the change. I'm a shy introvert, so anything involving other people is a hard task for me honestly haha.. If I were to be more open about my thoughts, I know I can go beyond stereotype threat because once the threat enters into my mind, it restricts me and makes me into what I'm not.
