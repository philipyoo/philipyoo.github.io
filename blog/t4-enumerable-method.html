        Probably one of my favorite methods I've run into in Ruby is the `map` method. Map is an `Enumerable` method. Within the `Enumerable` class, all the methods will go through an object to do some function. It is very similar to running an each loop through and doing something particular with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sure Enumerator methods are available for other Classes as well, but for now, I will only be focusing on Arrays or Hashes. Like many method names we've seen, usually the method name will sort of represent what action it will do. Map is a little more ambiguous, but it basically goes through some list (whether array or hash), and will change that list according to the block you pass it. Let's run some examples of Array objects first:
      </p>
      <div class="codeblock">
        <code class="prettyprint">
          some_array = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]<br/>
          some_array.map {|num| num * 2 }<br/>
          > [2, 6, 10, 14, 18]<br/>
          some_array.map {|num| num - 1 }<br/>
          > [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]<br/>
        </code>
      </div>
      <p>
        Ok, so from the code above, we see that if we use the method `map` on an array `some_array` and pass it a block, it will change all of the numbers inside the array with whatever instructions you put within the block. We can also see that using `map` is not a destructive method. If you wanted to save these changes, you would have to either use the bang (!) method or set it equal to a variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lets take a look at Hashes now:
      </p>
      <div class="codeblock">
        <code class="prettyprint">
          some_hash = {<br/>
            &nbsp;"apple" => 3,<br/>
            &nbsp;"bacon" => 2,<br/>
            &nbsp;"eggs" => 6,<br/>
            &nbsp;"milk" => 1<br/>
          }<br/>
          some_hash.map {|k, v| v + 2 }<br/>
          > [5, 4, 8, 3]<br/>
          some_hash.map {|k, v| k.capitalize }<br/>
          > ["Apple", "Bacon", "Eggs", "Milk"]<br/>
          some_hash.map {|k, v| {k.capitalize => v + 1} }<br/>
          > [{"Apple"=>4}, {"Bacon"=>3}, {"Eggs"=>7}, {"Milk"=>2}]<br/>
        </code>
      </div>
      <p>
        Hashes are a bit different. We passed it 2 arguments inside the pipes ||. One represents the key, and one represents the value. In the first example, we added 2 to the value, and it only returned the values that have been changed within an Array. Notice how we passed a Hash to method `map` and we got an Array instead. Again, the `map` method is a non-destructive method. But, Hashes can't use the `map!` destructive method. You can however create a new variable to store the results, but remember that the results will be an Array.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the next example, we are now using the keys and changing them. So the result returns an Array with all capitalized keys.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the third example, I tried to change both the key and value. There are a few ways to do it, but I stored it inside separate Hashes, and these will all be within one larger Array. The `map` method can't change the original Hash, so we don't have a destructive method available for it. But, it does come in handy when you want to go through either the keys or the values and make some changes to them and store them separately in a new variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sure there are tons of ways to utilize the `map` method that weren't covered in this post. But from my perspective and from my own experiences, this is what I found really useful for me when I was solving Ruby exercises.
