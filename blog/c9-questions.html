          <p>
            There are never any bad or stupid questions. This statement that has been told to us throughout our school lives holds true and will always hold true. If the question is relevant to the current topic or relevant to a previous topic, that question is helpful. Many times, it helps your peers as well, whether they had the same question, or they had an idea of the topic and the answer to your question helped define their idea further.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm going to be completely frank. The internet and its community can be pretty brutal sometimes. Even though you may ask a valid question, you may get shotdown (i.e. downvoted) and criticized because you (1) didn't format correctly, (2) asked in the wrong forum, (3) didn't follow the posting rules, (4) asked a question that has already been asked, (5) they hate you (joking - hopefully?), and the list goes on..
          </p>
          <p>
            As a fledgling programmer who has only got his feet wet and dabbled in a few different languages and frameworks, I asked <b>tons</b> of questions, mainly on Stack Overflow and Reddit. I've had my good share of downvotes and upvotes to these questions, and it can get discouraging at times when people get very critical of your question.
          </p>
          <p>
            A good way to avoid the dreaded downvotes is always ask your question in a broader spectrum. It's always nice to just copy-paste your code with your question, and ask people. But lets be real here, people don't want to read your long lines of code, debug it, and basically do your work for you. It's nice when someone will commit that time to help you, but I would say it's uncommon.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your question has to do with a programming concept, there are already a ton of answers online. If you still are confused, think about what is confusing about the concept. Can you pinpoint the specific reason why this concept doesn't make sense still? If so, check for that specific topic again. If you don't find an answer, then try asking and be detailed about it. Give examples if you can.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your question is related to an error in your code, maybe consider posting your code in an online text editor. If your code is long, can you whittle it down to a few lines and pinpoint where your error is occuring? If you do whittle it down, always mention you did so, and give some information about necessary components of your code, like variables or objects that are used in the shortened version of your code. If you can't whittle it down, can you create a short replica of it?
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to debugging your code and asking about your errors online, this is really something you should figure out yourself. Do you understand the error message? Do you know where the error is occuring? Try going back and seeing why it's popping up. If your code is built into separate methods or classes, check the return statements for each. If you still can't figure it out, and there isn't someone you can ask in-person, then I would probably ask online.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of questions have already been answered. It really comes down to, can you find it? Googling can be tough for a beginner, but remember, there are tons of resources out there. There is a good chance your question has already been answered. Transform your question to a broader scheme and try and googling that.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are set guidelines to asking questions, and I would always recommend you read the posting rules prior to posting to an online community, like Stack Overflow, Quora, or Reddit. Also, make sure the question hasn't already been asked. Try googling your question(s) and see what pops up. Google your questions both specifically and as broadly as possible to check all possible answers.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you are learning a new concept, a new topic, a new language, etc, you are always going to have millions of questions popping up. I think time management is important in regards to asking questions. Some questions you will be able to figure out yourself. Some questions will be answered as you delve deeper into your learning. Some questions you just need to ask others about. Asking questions may not get you an answer right away. Also, sometimes answers are already available with a simple search. There are no bad questions, but make good use of your time and others' time as well. Be considerate and be diligent.
