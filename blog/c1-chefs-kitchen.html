      On <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat</a>

      <p>
        Into my first week of DBC, I already can see that the program centers not only on the teaching experience, but in developing culture and empowering the students to strive for a truly life-changing event.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watching Shereef's Fireside Chat, I felt reassured that I made the right choice to come to DBC in order to pursue a career as a programmer/web developer. It should be a life changing event because students are equipped with a new tool (ability to program and create things) and they are also taught important life lessons along the way, with the addition of lessons about emotional intelligence, time management/productivity, social networking, encouraging a team environment, among many other topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I have a lot to work on, I believe I can fit well into this culture. I love learning with others. In fact, I learn best by learning with others, struggling through problems together, making mistakes together, teaching others, and also learning from others. I can get competitive at times, but I agree with Shereef that being competitive can be detrimental in a learning environment. I hope that throughout my experience at DBC, that I will be ignorant, that I will ask questions when I need to, that I don't hold back in my experience there, and that I can be open and have a creative and fun experience with everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm excited and nervous about my experience going into CS and starting DBC. Shereef mentioned in the video that one of the most common fears of students is falling behind the class and feeling like the rest of the class is way ahead. I tend to overthink things, and when I get nervous or worried, it can hinder my thought process. Because of these tendencies, I do feel insecure and lacking when I think that I know barely anything about programming. I don't have a CS background and I started picking up Ruby a few months ago using free online resources. I hope that I can overcome these fears of mine and truly pursue this experience wholeheartedly. Ultimately, I look forward to becoming a world-class beginner.
