          <p>
            The further I researched it, the more surprised I got. The issues with diversity in the tech industry honestly surprised me. I guess I have a very narrow view of the industry and only have a few examples to base off of.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some titles representative of the tech industry I found among articles were "Technology's Man Problem", "Sexism In Tech", and "How Women In Tech Are Losing". Wow.. I always viewed the tech industry as a goal-oriented industry where people collaborated in order to build things to make peoples' lives easier. In retrospect though, I always knew it was a male-dominated industry, and I can see why now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of hostile and unfair working conditions, more and more qualified and experienced women in tech are leaving the field because they often feel unwelcome in their working environments, and often feel as if they are being pushed out of the way rather than being utilized for their skills. Unfair conditions are seen not only within the working environment, but also during hiring periods and job promotional periods.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to an <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">article by Paul Ford</a>, "the problem with women in technology isn't the women." Coder gender shows 92.1% Men, 5.7% Women, and the rest not disclosed or other. Coding experience broken down by years shows the graph for men as equally split amongst the years. For women, the graph shows over 40% with less than 2 years of experience, and less for every year of experience above 2. The graph can be representative of the many experienced women leaving the industry. Gender issues became so prevalent that Tech Conference organizations had to release codes of conduct to address the ever growing problems that Women have been facing.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Harvard study found that most women in the industry said the negative conditions against them were subtle and therefore were difficult to dispute.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are already many organizations that are addressing the cultural issues in Tech. Many organizations are trying to attract more women to the industry, some even have support groups within the companies for the women to organize and share amongst each other their experiences and knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            From my personal macro view, I see the tech industry as a lagging cultural bubble. The worldwide culture has already dramatically transformed in the past few years and it is exponentially growing and changing. The tech industry will continue to bring in this younger generation and the culture within will start to evolve, even if adamant about it. It will inevitabily change for the better.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a more proactive approach, I believe (especially within tech) teamwork is essential to success. I can already tell the people within my cohort are diverse, hungry, and caring. We work together to reach an end-goal. We struggle together and learn off of each other. I believe the culture at DBC is very nurturing and supportive, and although we are all fairly new to this industry, we don't hold any bias and we won't build any biases throughout the program. As this newer generation enters the industry, I know without a doubt in my mind that there will be change. I hope to be a part of that change and witness the changes within this industry.
