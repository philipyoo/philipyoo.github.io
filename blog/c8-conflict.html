        Q: Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
      </p>
      <p>
        So, the following experience isn't a good example of how to deal with conflict. But it was an experience I had and wanted to reflect on, and see if ever in a similar situation, if I could approach the problem better.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the ripe age of 11, during one particular Sunday morning at church, I vaguely remember when two people from my year were picking fun at me. I had a relatively good relationship with both of them, but they were kind of like the class clowns and would sometimes go overboard with their fun. I don't recollect exactly what they did to anger me, but it was borderline bullying and I would have none of that. I showed them that I was not happy with what they were doing to me, and clearly told them to stop. But they didn't. They were apparently having way too much fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: What was the source of the conflict?
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm usually a very quiet guy, so maybe because I can take a certain extent of someone's joking, they probably started off playfully, but as they continued and had their fun, they probably started to go overboard with their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, I was patient. I let them have their fun but I don't think I encouraged them to continue or go deeper into their fun. When they continued, I felt annoyed, and expressed the annoyance to them to basically tell them to stop. As it continued, I snapped and got very angry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
      </p>
      <p>
        I was pretty pissed at this point. I told one of them to meet me in back after our class was over. I intended on fighting him, and I could tell he knew what I meant. This is definitely not the right solution, and I definitely wasn't thinking straight. Anger got the best of me.
      </p>
      <p>
        After class, I waited out in back for the person. He never showed up, and when I went inside one of the buildings, I saw him talking with the other guy. He basically told the other guy that I asked to fight him, and I never showed up. He twisted the story to make himself look better. This angered me further, but I didn't pursue it further and just left. I don't clearly remember what I was thinking at this point, but I'm sure I was fuming. After this all happened, they never bothered me again. We would still hang out amongst our group of friends, as if this whole ordeal never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
      </p>
      <p>
        Responding to conflict with physical intent is definitely not the right answer. I'm sure if I did physically fight this guy, not only would both of us get in a lot of trouble, but I believe I would have been labeled as a troublemaker. There are so many possible scenarios that could've happened from the aftermath of a fight. Even my family could have been wrapped into this ordeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        In retrospect, I'm glad that this didn't get bigger than it could have gotten. Also, given the results, I couldn't have asked for a better conclusion, but I obtained it through the wrong methods. I was young, I was confident because I was actively learning TaeKwonDo at the time, and I didn't really know how to respond to a situation like this because I've never experienced something like this before.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I could go back and do this differently, I would have wanted to be more assertive when telling them to stop. Since I didn't really tell them to stop but showed them I was annoyed, this might have translated to them wanting to annoy me further because they saw that I wasn't doing anything about it. We were all young, and as kids, we don't know any better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: What did you learn from this experience?
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes you have to draw the line. Sometimes you just have to be up-front and tell the other person. It could be a situation where the other person doesn't know. It could be a situation where they are doing it on purpose, but you would find out they are doing it on purpose and find out why they are doing it. Find the source of the problem and resolve it to the best of your ability. They could even be doing something on purpose because of something you did unknowingly: a misunderstanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be open, be assertive if need be, and try to stop problems at the root cause. If you fight problems with more problems, it will only escalate the situation, and will only lead to even more problems.
