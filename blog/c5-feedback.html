            The hardest things about learning how to program are how to effectively use the available resources at hand, staying motivated, enduring and surpassing any roadblocks you run into while learning, and staying focused on the current problem and trying not to get too sidetracked.
          </p>
          <p>
            One very effective way to address these problems is pair programming. You meet with a peer via online or in-person, and you try to solve a problem together. Two minds are greater than one, and although you may have figured out a way to solve a certain problem, your partner may bring up another solution that is more effective, or may mention a certain syntax or method that you weren't previously familiar with and it becomes a good learning opportunity you may not have experienced if you were programming by yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            A common rule when pair programming is to split roles into <b>Navigator</b> and <b>Driver</b>. There are many different definitions of each. My personal definition of a Navigator is one who guides the Driver and plans ahead. The Driver is the one on the keyboard typing. If the Driver has another idea for approaching the problem, they should chime in and give their input. Also, if the Navigator notices any errors in the code, they should mention it to the Driver. It is important the Driver stops the Navigator if the Driver feels that there is a better approach or the current solution is not effective. It is best to avoid foreseeable road blocks.
          </p>
          <p>
            When pair programming, the Navigator and Driver should keep track of the time and switch roles evenly. This way, both programmers can experience both roles. An effective way of keeping track of time is to timebox. Timebox is where you agree on a set time (i.e. 20 minutes), and after the set time is met, spend a few minutes discussing the current progress and/or taking a break, and then switch roles and continue the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            My personal experience with pairing has been great. Not only am I learning new things from my partner, but when I'm explaining a concept or method to my partner, it reinforces my understanding of that concept or method. Also, it is easy to lose motivation when you are learning by yourself. Knowing that there are other students in your situation and being able to pair program with them really helps boost your motivation. Being able to speak with a peer and learn with them really makes the learning process more fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Dev Bootcamp, after each pair programming session, you must submit feedback of your partner. The feedback should contain positive and constructive comments so that your partner knows what they are doing well at and what they should improve on. This is really effective since feedback is submitted by your peers and you may find out you should improve on something and you were previously unaware of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feedback I've received has been very supportive, and I want to give feedback to my partners according to how I want to receive them. Constructive feedback is very helpful because a lot of the times, you just don't realize your flaws or bad habits, and gives you an opportunity to address them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the feedback I've received, I should be more vocal about my ideas. Oftentimes, I may start to bring up my idea, but I would become doubtful and hold back what I wanted to say. Also, although I haven't received this constructive comment from anyone, I believe I should work on listening to my partner better and timeboxing the roles better.
          </p>

            If you are new to programming, give pair programming a shot. Feel free to <a href="mailto:philipyoo10@gmail.com" target="_top">email me</a> if you want resources to learn Ruby or JavaScript. Some of these resources have free chat rooms where you can find a peer to pair program with.
