            <b>Describe version control:</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine a master or final copy of your file. Now imagine 5 or so people looking at that file and making their own changes to it. All their changes immediately updates the changes to that file. This would lead to tons of headaches. It's like you're writing an essay for one of your classes, but there are several other people messing with your essay and there is no way for you to keep track of all those changes and you can't continue writing your essay successfully because unknown changes keep getting made.
          </p>
          <p>
            Version control allows you and several other people, even hundreds of other people work on the same file together without stepping on anyones toes. Version control lets many people work on "copies" of the master copy. There are several "versions" of the updated file, all with their own separate changes made to them. Once one person is finished with their changes, they submit their changed file back to the master copy. But before any changes are finalized, the people working together on the code can discuss the changes and finalize any new changes when in agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Explain how git tracks changes:</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Git is a nifty, easy-to-use version control tool available for anyone to use. There are 3 main steps: unstaged, staged, and git directory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Assuming that your folder has been setup as a local git repository, whenever you make any changes to any of the files within this folder, it will only save these changes locally on your device. But, if you're working with several other people on the same file (see version control above), you will need to submit these changes where everyone has access to the changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you make changes locally on your device, the updated files are still in the "unstaged" part of version control. In order to add these changes, first you will need to add it:
          </p>
          <p>  <!-- PRETTIFY -->
            $ git add "filename"
          </p>
          <p>
            Now the changed files are "staged". But these changes aren't finalized. The "staged" part is where you can double-check your work before committing it and making final changes. To commit changes:
          </p>
          <p>  <!-- PRETTIFY -->
            $ git commit -m "any message about your update here"
          </p>
          <p>
            Now your changes have been updated with the "git directory". If you're working on the file with others in the office, these changes should show for everyone and people can also keep track of all changes that are being made. If you're working outside of the office, lets say at home, and everyone else working on the file is also doing the same, you will need to make these changes and send them to the internet. A common online tool used is called GitHub in order to store all these changes. More on GitHub will be explained in the next question.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Evaluate the benefits of using GitHub to store code:</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            GitHub is like an online folder where you can save all your work. If your work is has a bunch of folders and files all within one folder, if you save this folder to GitHub, GitHub will save all the changes and keep all the folders and files inside in the same spots.
          </p>
          <p>
            GitHub is an awesome tool because it is free, contains tons of open source code, and allows you to save your files online so that other people can use those files and make changes to those files as well. GitHub lets programmers work anywhere where the internet is available and everyone doesn't need to be all in the same place together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with git, GitHub is a nice and convenient tool for all programmers.
          </p>
