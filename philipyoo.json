      "After graduating college, I tried my hand at a lot of different jobs. I interacted with a wide range of people and gained a lot of invaluable experiences, and yet there was still something missing-- everything was still \"just a job\". Reflecting on my past experiences, I knew I wanted to build things that would benefit others. In pursuit of something more, I dropped everything and wholly dedicated myself to learning to program.",
      "I attended Dev Bootcamp, where I spent 1000+ hours learning to program applications and build websites. I worked on projects in pairs or in groups and was able to clearly communicate ideas to the team. I learned about engineering empathy and how that can affect a team's performance. I approached many of my projects structurally from a user's point-of-view while applying Agile development. I picked up new technologies within days and applied them to relevant projects. And...I did this all while enjoying the experience.",
      "I am a full-stack web developer who has a strong desire to build meaningful and fun applications. I am currently seeking opportunities to apply and expand upon my current skill sets. I am a quick learner who enjoys problem-solving, gaming, and contributing to a team environment."
